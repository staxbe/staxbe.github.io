<p class="six">Picking Alibi is an invitation for a battle of wits with your opponents. This Defender is all about finding clever ways to force the Attackers’ hands. Any hesitation comes at a heavy price.</p> 
<p class="six">The character of Alibi was inspired by undercover infiltration specialists in the Italian Raggruppamento Operativo Speciale unit. She is a cunning woman with a gift for infiltrating dense networks of organized crime.</p> 
<p class="six">Her name is Aria de Luca. She was born in Tripoli, Libya and immigrated with her family when she was three years old. Her father managed a small ordnance manufacturer, using his contacts to open up exports. De Luca earned her understanding of Italian firearms through the family business and training on the shooting range. At 18, Aria entered the European Championships, and won gold in two divisions. Following the event, a Carabinieri recruiter convinced her to join the police force.</p> 
<p class="six">De Luca’s precision shooting skills shot her up the ranks, and she served for a time with the elite Raggruppamento Operativo Speciale in fighting organized crime. She eventually earned a spot in the Gruppo Intervento Speciale (G.I.S.), and following a successful operation in Afghanistan despite being separated from her unit, she was singled out for undercover work in organized crime. She infiltrated the Vinciguerra Crime Family and spent several years among them before bringing them down from the inside.</p>
